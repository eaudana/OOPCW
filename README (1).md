#   Westminster Shopping Manager

Description:

This project aims to develop a comprehensive system for managing products using both a console-based interface for administrative tasks and a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interactions.

Console System:

The console system provides functionalities for administrators to perform various tasks related to product management. These tasks include adding new products, deleting existing products, printing the list of products, and saving the product data.

Functionalities:

Add New Products: Administrators can add new products to the system by providing details such as product name, price, quantity, and any other relevant information.

Delete Products: Administrators have the capability to delete existing products from the system if needed.

Print Products: The system allows administrators to print the list of all products currently stored in the database.

Save Products: Administrators can save the product data to a file, ensuring that changes are persisted even after the system is closed.

Graphical User Interface (GUI):

The GUI provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the product catalog. Users can browse through available products, add them to their shopping cart, and visualize the final price before making a purchase.

Functionalities:

Product Selection: Users can browse through the list of available products displayed in the GUI and select the ones they wish to purchase.

Add to Cart: Selected products can be added to the shopping cart with the option to specify the quantity desired.

Visualize Final Price: The GUI dynamically calculates and displays the total price of items in the shopping cart, allowing users to visualize the cost before proceeding to checkout.

Checkout: Users have the option to proceed to checkout once they have finalized their selection, where they can provide payment and shipping details to complete the purchase.
